# Quizzes-App

In this project, Users can log in and create their accounts for this I used the Firebase authentication system. It has a very interesting UI for this I used Cardview because it has an easy way to show information inside cards that have a consistent look.  The quizzes on the app are based on the date means every day you have different quizzes I also added a feature that in the middle of the quiz user can go back to previous questions. At the end of the quiz, a result report is generated which states the score. I Used Firebase cloud Firestore for the backend.
